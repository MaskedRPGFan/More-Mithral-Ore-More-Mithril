# More Mithral Ore

## Introduction

Get more [Mithral Ore](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Mithral_Ore) in an immersive way and with a variety of possibilities.

Main file will:
* ➡️ hide [Mithral Ore](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Mithral_Ore) in some places,
* ➡️ create different types of Mithral Veins, which will yield varying amounts of ore (small — 1, medium — 2 and big — 3),
* ➡️ let you get ore from Grym (3),
* ➡️ let you get ore from Lava Elemental (1).

A new game is needed to make all new Ore Veins drop ore, but the rest will work even in ongoing game.

## Optional Files

Add-ons from optional files section can be used together with main file to let you buy ore from merchants (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10) if you want to have more Mithral Ore.

Current list of add-ons:

* ✳️ Merchants — A:
  * ➡️ 1 Mithral Ore in merchants' shops and tutorial chests.
* ✳️ Merchants — B:
  * ➡️ 2 Mithral Ore in merchants' shops and tutorial chests.
* ✳️ Merchants — C:
  * ➡️ 3 Mithral Ore in merchants' shops and tutorial chests.

## FAQ

### Installation/Updating/Uninstallation?

Anytime. This mod leaves nothing in the save.

### Why more [Mithral Ore](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Mithral_Ore)?

Its larger quantities will be needed to strengthen and create equipment in my mods like [Unique Gear - Titanstring](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1261).

### Is a long rest required to add new items to vendors if the addon was installed mid playthrough?

Yes.
